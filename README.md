CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell
================================

My solutions for this course. Week 2 contains the mastermind
assignment from the 2015 version. However
[bitemyapp/learnhaskell](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) recommends
the 2013 version for self study, so I went back to that for week three. Perhaps
I'll do some assignments from both along the way.
